# JavaScript Mocking Fundamentals

When running tests, you don't want to make network requests. That could be expensive and slow. Instead of running your code exactly as it would run in production, we can modify how some JS modules and functions work during tests to avoid unreliability and improve the speed. This kind of modification can be stubs, mocks or test doubles.

> Mocking allows our test to be deterministic and ensure that we wil get the expected result ever time.

## Monkey patching

The most na√Øve approach to mocking in JavaScript is to override an object's properties in the test.

Suppose that we have a `utils.js` file that exports a `getWinner` function, and lets pretend that this function performs some expensive proccess like a request to an API.

```js
// utils.js

// Returns the winning player or null for a tie.
//
// Let's pretend that this function is performing an
// expensive network request or process for determinating
// the winner.
//
function getWinner(player1, player2) {
  const winningNumber = Math.random();
  return winningNumber < 1 / 3
    ? player1
    : winningNumber < 2 / 3
      ? player2
      : null;
}

module.exports = { getWinner };
```

And we have a function `thumbWar.js` that uses the `utils.getWinner` function.

```js
// thumbWar.js

const utils = require('./utils');

function thumbWar(player1, player2) {
  const numberToWin = 2;
  
  let player1Wins = 0;
  let player2Wins = 0;

  while (player1Wins < numberToWin && player2Wins < numberToWin) {
    const winner = utils.getWinner(player1, player2);
    if (winner === player1) {
      player1Wins++;
    } else if (winner === player2) {
      player2Wins++;
    }
  }

  return player1Wins > player2Wins ? player1 : player2;
}

module.exports = thumbWar;
```

If we want to test the function `thumbWar` in a production environment the test will be expensive, because it uses the `getWinner` function. In order to avoid the expensive process, we can override the `getWinner` function during the test.

```js
// __tests__/no-framework/monkey-patching.test.js

const thumbWar = require('../../thumb-war');
const utils = require('../../utils');

const originalGetWinner = utils.getWinner;

// The function getWinner is overrided to avoid the expensive process
utils.getWinner = (p1, p2) => p1;

test('the thumbWar function', () => {
  const winner = thumbWar('Diego Villa', 'Adolfo Jose');
  expect(winner).toBe('Diego Villa');
});

// After we finish the test we need to return to the original function
utils.getWinner = originalGetWinner;
```
